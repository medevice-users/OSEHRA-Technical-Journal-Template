\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This paper presents the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS), that
provides a single interface for health care providers to review and update a
patient’s medical record, and to place orders, including medications, special
procedures, x-rays, patient care nursing orders, diets, and laboratory tests.
CPRS is flexible enough to be implemented in a wide variety of settings for a
broad spectrum of health care workers, and provides a consistent, event-driven,
Windows-style interface.

\section{Introduction}

The Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) is a graphical user interface
intended for clinicians in 1997. CPRS provides a single interface for health
care providers to review and update a patient’s medical record, and to place
orders, including medications, special procedures, x-rays, patient care nursing
orders, diets, and laboratory tests. CPRS is flexible enough to be implemented
in a wide variety of settings for a broad spectrum of health care workers, and
provides a consistent, event-driven, Windows-style interface.

CPRS organizes and presents all relevant data on a patient in a way that
directly supports clinical decision-making. The comprehensive cover sheet
displays timely, patient-centric information, including active problems,
allergies, current medications, recent laboratory results, vital signs,
hospitalization, and outpatient clinic history. This information is displayed
immediately when a patient is selected, and provides an accurate overview of
the patient’s current status before clinical interventions are ordered. CPRS
capabilities include:

\begin{itemize}

\item A Real-Time Order Checking System that alerts clinicians during the
ordering session that a possible problem could exist if the order is processed.

\item A Notification System that immediately alerts clinicians about clinically
significant events.

\item A Patient Posting System, displayed on every CPRS screen, that alerts
clinicians to issues related specifically to the patient, including crisis
notes, warning, adverse reactions, and advance directives

\item The Clinical Reminder System, which allows caregivers to track and
improve preventive health care for patients and ensure timely clinical
interventions are initiated.

\item Remote Data View functionality that allows clinicians to view a patient’s
medical history from other VA facilities to ensure the clinician has access to
all clinically relevant data available at VA facilities.

\end{itemize}
